# Trading Simulation Platform

This project is a backend-only **Trading Simulation Platform** designed to demonstrate
backend architecture, microservices design and reactive programming using **Kotlin**.

The platform simulates the core components of a brokerage system:
accounts, orders and portfolios, focusing on **consistency, clean architecture
and scalability** rather than real market connectivity.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Practice backend development using **Kotlin**
- Apply **microservices architecture**
- Use **reactive programming** with Spring WebFlux and coroutines
- Design a clean and explicit **domain model**
- Showcase architectural decisions suitable for **financial environments**

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

The platform is composed of independent microservices:

- **account-service**: user accounts and balances
- **order-service**: order lifecycle management
- **portfolio-service**: positions and portfolio calculation

Each service follows **Clean Architecture** principles:
- Domain
- Application
- Infrastructure
- API (controllers)

Services communicate via **REST APIs**.
Authentication is handled using **JWT**.
